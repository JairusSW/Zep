# Manifesto

 - *Transparent.* Zep doesn't do anything that would create side-effects without your permission.
 - *Performant.* Zep compiles directly to WebAssembly and is designed to be closely related to the low-level semantics of WebAssembly.
 - *Configurable.* Zep gives you the freedom to change the Standard Library and edit source files while staying distributable.
 - *Productivity.* Zep provides intellisense and a strong checker to catch problems before they arise.
