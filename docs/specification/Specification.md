# Manifesto

- _Transparent._ Zep doesn't do anything that would create side-effects without your permission.
- _Performant._ Zep compiles directly to WebAssembly and is designed to be closely related to the low-level semantics of WebAssembly.
- _Configurable._ Zep gives you the freedom to change the Standard Library and edit source files while staying distributable.
- _Productivity._ Zep provides intellisense and a strong checker to catch problems before they arise.
